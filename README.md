# Python Personal Task Manager

## Description

A small personal side project with the focus of creating a fully functioning modular program that will track tasks. Tasks can be added via user input and will be written out to an external file which is located in the program's root directory. Tasks may be categorized into three different priority levels which are Low, Medium, and High priority. This task manager allows you to filter your tasks as well from completed tasks, the different priority levels, tasks that are WIP, and every single task documented. Lastly, you can update tasks, change it's priorities, and remove any unwanted / finished tasks.
